Game programming is a great way to learn how to program. You use many tools that youâ€™ll see in the real world, plus you get to play a game to test your results! An ideal game to start your Python game programming journey is rock paper scissors.


For those who do not know, rock, paper, scissors is a multiplayer hand game. After uttering the phrase "rock, paper, scissors," participants simultaneously shape their hands into a fist, a piece of paper (palm down), or a pair of scissors (two fingers outstretched). The guidelines are simple:

1.Rock shatters scissors.(Rock wins)
2.Rock is covered in paper.(Paper wins)
3.Paper is sliced with scissors. (Scissor wins)
